# `kubectl-ate`

A Kubernetes-native CLI plugin for managing Substrate Actor and Worker lifecycles.

## Running the CLI

There are two ways to run the tool, depending on whether you are developing locally or installing it permanently.

### 1. Install as a native `kubectl` Plugin
You can use `go install` to compile the tool and place the binary directly into your Go bin directory (which should be in your `$PATH`). Because the source folder is named `kubectl-ate`, Kubernetes will automatically recognize the resulting binary!

```bash
go install ./cmd/kubectl-ate
```
You can now run it seamlessly anywhere as a native Kubernetes command: `kubectl ate <command>`.

### 2. Run directly from source (Development)
If you are testing changes to the codebase, you can bypass compilation and run the CLI directly from the source tree:

```bash
go run ./cmd/kubectl-ate <command>
```

## Connection & Auto Port-Forwarding
By default, `kubectl-ate` will automatically read your `~/.kube/config`, discover the `ate-api-server` pods in your cluster, and establish a temporary background port-forward tunnel to execute gRPC calls securely.

If you prefer to route traffic directly (e.g., through a LoadBalancer or when running natively inside a cluster pod), simply provide the `--endpoint` flag to bypass the tunnel.

## Tracing
The CLI supports on-demand tracing using the `--trace` flag. When enabled, the CLI will generate a trace ID and signal to the server that it wants the request to be traced.

**Prerequisites:**

1. The Google Cloud project must have the **Cloud Trace API** enabled. You can enable it using:
```bash
gcloud services enable cloudtrace.googleapis.com --project=PROJECT_ID
```

2. The GKE cluster must have **Managed OpenTelemetry** enabled. Clusters created by
`setup-gcp create cluster` or `setup-gcp bootstrap` always enable it. For a cluster that does
not have it, enable it with:

```bash
gcloud beta container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
    --project=PROJECT_ID \
    --managed-otel-scope=COLLECTION_AND_INSTRUMENTATION_COMPONENTS \
    --location=LOCATION
```

**Local (kind):**

The kind overlay installed by `hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-ate-system` already provisions an in-cluster OpenTelemetry Collector and a Jaeger all-in-one in the `otel-system` namespace. No additional setup is required.

Port-forward the Jaeger UI and invoke any command with `--trace`:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n otel-system svc/jaeger 16686:16686 &
kubectl ate get actor my-counter-1 --trace
# open http://localhost:16686 and search for the most recent trace
```

## Global Flags
These flags can be appended to any command:

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--kubeconfig` | | Path to your kubeconfig file | `~/.kube/config` |
| `--context` | | Name of the kubeconfig context to use | current context |
| `--endpoint` | | Manual gRPC endpoint override (e.g., `localhost:8080`) | |
| `--token-file` | | Path to a bearer token for ate-api authentication, or `-` for stdin | Kubernetes ServiceAccount token |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output format (`table`, `json`, `yaml`) | `table` |
| `--trace` | | Enable on-demand tracing for the request | `false` |

## Command Reference & Examples

### Getting Resources
List and inspect the state of actors and workers across the cluster.

```bash
# List actors in one atespace; -a is shorthand for --atespace
kubectl ate get actors --atespace <atespace>
kubectl ate get actors -a <atespace>

# List actors across all atespaces
kubectl ate get actors -A

# Get a specific actor by name and output as raw YAML
kubectl ate get actor <actor-name> --atespace <atespace> -o yaml

# List all physical workers and see which actors are assigned to them
kubectl ate get workers

# Filter workers by Kubernetes namespace, assigned-actor atespace, or
# worker pool labels (same flags as `top workers`)
kubectl ate get workers -n <namespace>
kubectl ate get workers -a <atespace>
kubectl ate get workers -l <label-selector>
```

> **Note:** `get actors` requires either `--atespace <name>` / `-a <name>` (one atespace) or `-A`/`--all-atespaces` (all atespaces) — there is no default atespace. Getting a single actor always requires `--atespace`/`-a`, since an actor is addressed by `(atespace, name)`. `-a` (lower-case) scopes to one atespace; `-A` (upper-case) spans all.

> **Note:** Actors, workers, and actor templates are not Kubernetes CRDs — they live in the Substrate control plane's PostgreSQL database, not `etcd`. `kubectl get actor`, `kubectl get worker`, and `kubectl get actortemplate` will not return anything; only `kubectl ate get …` queries the control plane (see [Actor Templates](#actor-templates)). `kubectl get workerpool` *does* work, because pools are CRDs.

#### `kubectl ate get actor` output columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ATESPACE` | The atespace the actor belongs to. Part of the actor's identity; folded into the storage key as `actor:<atespace>:<name>`. |
| `NAME` | The actor's name. User-provided for application actors; UUID for the golden actor that each template materialises during `ResumeGoldenActor`. |
| `TEMPLATE` | The `ActorTemplate` the actor was created from, displayed as `<atespace>/<name>`. |
| `STATE` | One of `ACTOR_STATE_RESUMING`, `ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING`, `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDING`, `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDED`. |
| `ATEOM POD` | The worker pod (namespace/name) currently hosting the actor. Empty while suspended. |
| `ATEOM IP` | The pod IP of that worker. Empty while suspended. |
| `VERSION` | Monotonic integer that increments on every state transition (resume / suspend / checkpoint). Useful for distinguishing snapshots. |
| `AGE` | Time elapsed since the actor was created. |

#### `kubectl ate get worker` output columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NAMESPACE` | The `WorkerPool` namespace. |
| `POOL` | The `WorkerPool` name. |
| `POD` | The worker pod name. |
| `STATUS` | `FREE` (idle, ready to receive an actor) or `ASSIGNED` (currently hosting an actor). |
| `ASSIGNED ACTOR` | If `STATUS=ASSIGNED`, the actor reference `<namespace>/<template>/<actor-name>`. |

### Atespaces

An **atespace** is the isolation boundary an actor belongs to. It must exist before you can create actors in it.

```bash
# Create an atespace
kubectl ate create atespace <atespace>

# List all atespaces
kubectl ate get atespaces

# Get an atespace
kubectl ate get atespace <atespace>

# Delete an atespace (must be empty — fails if any actors remain)
kubectl ate delete atespace <atespace>
```

> **Note:** `create actor … -a <atespace>` requires the atespace to already exist, otherwise it fails with `FailedPrecondition`. `delete atespace` only removes an **empty** atespace; delete its actors and snapshot tags first (cascade delete is not yet supported).

#### `kubectl ate get atespace` output columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NAME` | The atespace name. Globally unique — atespaces are global-scoped. |
| `AGE` | Time elapsed since the atespace was created. |

### Actor Templates

An **actor template** describes what an actor runs: containers, volumes,
snapshot policy, sandbox runtime, and worker selection. Templates live in an
atespace and are immutable — there is no update; delete and recreate to change
one.

```bash
# Create a template from a manifest (protojson-shaped ateapipb.ActorTemplate,
# a single YAML/JSON document; use -f - for stdin). The metadata's atespace
# must already exist.
kubectl ate create actor-template -f template.yaml

# List templates, or get one (also: -o yaml prints the re-applyable manifest).
kubectl ate get actor-templates -a <atespace>
kubectl ate get actor-template <name> -a <atespace> -o yaml

# Delete a template. This also deletes its golden actor and golden snapshot.
kubectl ate delete actor-template <name> -a <atespace>
```

See
[`demos/counter/counter-template.yaml.tmpl`](../../demos/counter/counter-template.yaml.tmpl)
for a complete manifest example.

#### `kubectl ate get actor-templates` output columns

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ATESPACE` | The atespace the template belongs to. |
| `NAME` | The template's name. |
| `SANDBOX CLASS` | The sandbox runtime family (`SANDBOX_CLASS_GVISOR` or `SANDBOX_CLASS_MICROVM`). |
| `STATUS` | `Ready` once the golden snapshot exists (actors can be created), `Failed` otherwise. |
| `AGE` | Time elapsed since the template was created. |

### Actor Lifecycle
Manage the execution state of your workloads.
*(Note: Actors are identified by a user-provided name, which must be a valid DNS-1123 label)*

```bash
# Create a new actor deriving from an ActorTemplate. The template name is
# resolved in the actor's atespace. -a/--atespace is required and the
# atespace must already exist (kubectl ate create atespace <atespace>).
kubectl ate create actor my-actor --template-ref=<template-name> -a <atespace>

# Resume an actor (assigns it to a free worker and restores its state)
kubectl ate resume actor my-actor -a <atespace>

# Suspend an actor (snapshots its state to storage and frees the worker)
kubectl ate suspend actor my-actor -a <atespace>

# Delete an actor (by default, requires the actor to be SUSPENDED or CRASHED).
kubectl ate delete actor my-actor -a <atespace>

# Delete an actor from any state (e.g. RUNNING, PAUSED), terminating workloads and detaching volumes.
kubectl ate delete actor my-actor -a <atespace> --any-state
```

### Actor Snapshots

Suspending an actor creates a durable snapshot. Tags give snapshots stable,
Atespace-owned names; published tags may be used from other Atespaces.

```bash
# List snapshots, or resolve one canonical snapshot or tag.
kubectl ate get snapshots -a <atespace>
kubectl ate get snapshot <snapshot-name> -a <atespace>
kubectl ate get snapshot <tag-name> -a <atespace> --tag

# Tag a snapshot, then publish or unpublish the tag.
kubectl ate create snapshot-tag <tag-name> -a <atespace> --snapshot <snapshot-name>
kubectl ate update snapshot-tag <tag-name> -a <atespace> --scope published
kubectl ate update snapshot-tag <tag-name> -a <atespace> --scope atespace

# Create an actor from a tag and remove the tag when it is no longer needed.
kubectl ate create actor <actor-name> -a <atespace> --template <namespace/name> --snapshot-tag <tag-atespace/tag-name>
kubectl ate delete snapshot-tag <tag-name> -a <atespace>
```

### Logs

`kubectl ate logs` requires a resource-type subcommand; running `kubectl ate logs <actor-name>` on its own prints help. The only supported resource type is `actors`:

```bash
# Print the logs an actor has produced on its current worker.
# -a/--atespace is required, since an actor is addressed by (atespace, name).
kubectl ate logs actors my-actor -a <atespace>

# Follow the logs with -f. The stream is aggregated across worker
# reassignments, so the same actor stays queryable as it teleports between pods.
kubectl ate logs actors my-actor -a <atespace> -f

# Show only one container's logs with -c/--container.
kubectl ate logs actors my-actor -a <atespace> -c my-container
```

Logs are streamable only while the actor is bound to a worker (i.e., `ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING`). For history across worker migrations, route through a centralized log backend (Cloud Logging, Loki, etc.); see `docs/observability.md`.

### Administration & Setup
Commands for bootstrapping the Substrate control plane and debugging local environments.

```bash
# Generate a new Actor ID CA pool and push it directly to a Kubernetes Secret
kubectl ate admin make-ca-pool \
  --name actor-id-ca-pool \
  --secret-namespace ate-system \
  --ca-id "1"

# Generate a new JWT authority pool and push it to a Kubernetes Secret
kubectl ate admin make-jwt-pool \
  --name actor-id-jwt-pool \
  --secret-namespace ate-system \
  --key-id "1"

# DANGEROUS: Completely clear all Actor and Worker tracking state
kubectl ate admin debug-clear-store
```
