# Stage the assembled micro-VM asset set into the GCS snapshot bucket under

# The GKE counterpart of stage-to-rustfs.sh. Run after assemble.sh has produced $OUT.
#
# Requires the `gcloud` CLI authenticated for the bucket's project. Env: OUT (asset
# dir, default ./bin/microvm-assets/amd64), BUCKET (default ate-snapshots),
# PROJECT_ID (optional; passed to gcloud as --project when set).
