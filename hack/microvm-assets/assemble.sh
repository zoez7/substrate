# Assemble the micro-VM (kata + cloud-hypervisor) runtime asset set that
# ateom-microvm fetches at runtime (fetch-not-bake). Run this on a Linux
# host of the TARGET arch.
#
# Produces, under $OUT, the five assets named as the SandboxConfig expects:
#   cloud-hypervisor  virtiofsd  vmlinux  rootfs.img  configuration-clh.toml
# The DOWNLOADED assets are reproducible, so paste their sha256 sums into the
# manifest (manifests/microvm/sandboxconfig-microvm.yaml.tmpl). That now includes virtiofsd on
# amd64 (upstream prebuilt); on arm64 virtiofsd is still built from source
# (non-reproducible bytes), so its sha is NOT pinned there — run-microvm-demo.sh
# computes it from the staged binary and injects it at deploy.
#
# ateom drives the kata-agent directly (the kata containerd shim is NOT an asset). The
# actor rootfs is overlay(virtio-fs RO lower + guest-tmpfs upper), so virtiofsd IS an
# asset; kata-static (4.0.0 included) still bundles virtiofsd v1.13.3, whose old vhost
# hangs CH's restore handshake, so we take virtiofsd v1.14.0 — the first release with
# the vhost-0.16 / vhost-user-backend-0.22 snapshot-restore fix (REPLY_ACK). Upstream
# publishes a prebuilt static binary for x86_64 only; arm64 builds from the release
# tag, which needs rust (rustup) + libcap-ng-dev libseccomp-dev pkg-config.
#
# Env: ARCH (arm64|amd64, default arm64), KATA_VER (4.0.0), CH_VER (v53.0),
#      OUT (default ./bin/microvm-assets/$ARCH, under the gitignored bin/).
#
# Always re-downloads and overwrites — there is no incremental mode. It clears
# $OUT/.asset-versions before the first write and re-stamps it with the versions that
# produced the set only once the run completes, so the stamp is present only on a dir
# assembled end-to-end by those pins. install-microvm-deps.sh uses it to decide whether
# a cached $OUT is still current.
# `--print-stamp` prints that stamp for the current env and exits without downloading.
