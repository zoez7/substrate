# Micro-VM runtime assets + counter demo (kind, fetch-not-bake)

The `microvm` runtime (`cmd/ateom-microvm`, kata + cloud-hypervisor) fetches its
toolchain at runtime — nothing kata-specific is baked into the worker image. ateom drives
the kata-agent directly (no kata shim, no containerd). Each actor container's rootfs is an
overlay of a read-only lower (the OCI image, served into the guest over virtio-fs by
`virtiofsd`) and a writable upper on a guest tmpfs, so `virtiofsd` is part of the asset
set. The asset set is five files:

- `cloud-hypervisor` — the VMM binary (fetched from its release)
- `virtiofsd` — the virtio-fs daemon serving the RO lower (built from source; see `assemble.sh`)
- `vmlinux` — the guest kernel (from kata-static)
- `rootfs.img` — the guest rootfs image (from kata-static)
- `configuration-clh.toml` — the base kata config (from kata-static)

These helpers assemble the asset set for your node arch, stage it into the cluster's rustfs
S3 bucket, and the demo manifest's `SandboxConfig` points at it. When `/dev/kvm` is
available, `hack/create-kind-cluster.sh` mounts it into the node; atelet then advertises
it as a device, which is what places micro-VM workers there.

> demo apply) for kind OR GKE without editing committed files. The steps here are the
> manual equivalent.

## Steps (run on a KVM-capable Linux host matching the node arch)

1. **Assemble assets for your arch:**
   ```sh
   ARCH=arm64 hack/microvm-assets/assemble.sh
   ```
   Copy the printed sha256 sums into the `SandboxConfig` `spec.assets` in
   `manifests/microvm/sandboxconfig-microvm.yaml.tmpl` (the committed values are arm64; other arches differ).

2. **Bring up the cluster + control plane:**
   ```sh
   hack/create-kind-cluster.sh        # mounts /dev/kvm into the nodes
   hack/install-ate-kind.sh           # control plane + rustfs (bucket: ate-snapshots)
   ```

3. **Stage assets into rustfs:**
   ```sh
   OUT="$PWD/microvm-assets-arm64" hack/microvm-assets/stage-to-rustfs.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy the demo + drive it:**
   ```sh
   hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-demo-counter-microvm
   ```
   That applies the worker pool, creates the `counter-microvm` ActorTemplate through the ate
   API, and waits for its golden snapshot.
   Create an actor from `counter-microvm`, hit the in-RAM counter to increment it, suspend
   (checkpoint), resume on a different worker pod, and confirm the count continues — proving the
   guest-memory snapshot round-tripped across pods.

## Notes
- `assets` is single-arch (unlike runsc's amd64/arm64): stage assets matching the node arch.
