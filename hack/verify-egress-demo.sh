# The egress demo Actor accepts {"url":"..."} and performs an HTTP GET. With
# egress turned on, the Actor's outbound TCP is nftables-REDIRECTed
# into atunnel, wrapped in mTLS + HTTP CONNECT, and sent to the egress gateway,
# which terminates CONNECT and tunnels to the real destination. This script
# drives that path and shows the ext_proc authentication log proving the actor's
# client certificate + CONNECT authority were seen.
