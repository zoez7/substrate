# The egress demo: each variant applies a worker pool manifest, then creates
# its ActorTemplate as a substrate resource through the ate API with
# `kubectl ate create actor-template`. The micro-VM variants need the
# cluster-wide `microvm` SandboxConfig from hack/install-microvm-deps.sh
# --install; the MITM variants need an sdsmint install
# (--experimental-use-sdsmint), because their actors project the egress
# gateway trust bundle, which does not resolve otherwise.

ATE_DEMOS+=(demo-egress) # register demo-egress
# The micro-VM variant is its own demo rather than a flag on demo-egress: that
# gets it into --help and into delete_all's teardown sweep for free, and the two
# can be installed side by side (the networking suite runs against whichever the
# sandbox class under test selects).
ATE_DEMOS+=(demo-egress-microvm) # register demo-egress-microvm
# The MITM variants are separate demos for the same reason, plus one of their
# own: they project the egress gateway trust bundle, which only resolves on an
# sdsmint install, so they cannot be part of the demos a passthrough install
# deploys.
