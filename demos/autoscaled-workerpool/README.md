# Autoscaling WorkerPools with an HPA

This describes how to autoscale a `WorkerPool` on how many of its workers are
currently assigned, using a Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) fed by the
`ate_workerpool_workers` metric through prometheus-adapter.

## Prerequisites

- A local kind cluster with Agent Substrate installed (`./hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-ate-system`).
  Note: this demo is currently only supported on kind.
- `ko` installed for building images.
- A GCS bucket for storing snapshots (configured via `BUCKET_NAME` env var).

## Architecture (kind)

```
ate-api-server :9090/metrics          (ate_workerpool_workers, OTel -> Prometheus gauge)
        │  scrape (prometheus.io/scrape annotation, 15s)
        ▼
Prometheus                            manifests/ate-install/monitoring/prometheus.yaml
        │  PromQL
        ▼
prometheus-adapter                    demos/autoscaled-workerpool/prometheus-adapter.yaml
        │  external.metrics.k8s.io
        ▼
HorizontalPodAutoscaler
        │  /scale  (writes WorkerPool.spec.replicas)
        ▼
atecontroller  ──►  Deployment.spec.replicas  ──►  worker pods
```
## HPA Configuration (External + AverageValue)

The example HPA uses an **External** metric with target type **AverageValue**:

```
desiredReplicas = ceil( metricValue / target.averageValue )
```

where `metricValue = max(ate_workerpool_workers{namespace=<ns>, name=<pool>, state=assigned})`:
the pool's assigned-worker count. WorkerPool names are only unique within a
namespace, so the selector must pin both.

`averageValue` is the target **assigned-workers-per-replica**:

| `averageValue` | Meaning                                     | Example (`assigned=7`) |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `"0.7"` (700m) | ~70% assigned / 30% idle headroom (default) | `ceil(7/0.7) = 10`     |
| `"1"`          | pack to 100%, no idle headroom              | `ceil(7/1) = 7`        |
| `"0.5"` (500m) | lots of headroom, ~2× replicas              | `ceil(7/0.5) = 14`     |

Lower `averageValue` → more idle headroom → more replicas.

### Scale-up/scale-down behavior

The example HPAs set an aggressive `scaleUp` (no stabilization window,
`selectPolicy: Max`, `Percent 100` / `Pods 10` steps) so a burst is served in a
**batch** rather than creeping up one worker at a time, and a slow `scaleDown`
(300s stabilization) to avoid flapping. `behavior` only sets the _rate of change_;
the HPA still scales to what the metric dictates.

## How to Run on Agent Substrate

### 1. Build and Deploy

```sh
# Local dev (kind)
./hack/install-ate-kind.sh --deploy-demo-autoscaled-workerpool
```

This command will:

- Deploy `prometheus-adapter` into `ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool` to serve `ate_workerpool_workers` on `external.metrics.k8s.io`.
- Create the `ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool` namespace.
- Create one `WorkerPool` (`counter`, starting with 5 replicas), one `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` (`counter`), and the `counter` actor template through the ate API (`kubectl ate create actor-template`) in the `ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool` atespace.
- Wait until the template is `Ready` and the pool is rolled out.

### 2. Verify Monitoring Stack & External Metric

Confirm that `prometheus-adapter` is serving the external metric:

```sh
# 1. Adapter is serving the External Metrics API
kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io          # Available=True

# 2. The external metric resolves for the counter pool
kubectl get --raw "/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool/ate_workerpool_workers?labelSelector=ate_worker_state%3Dassigned,ate_workerpool_namespace%3Date-demo-autoscaled-workerpool,ate_workerpool_name%3Dcounter"
```

## How to Use

We can trigger autoscaling by spawning multiple actors and sending traffic to assign workers in the pool:

### 1. Spawn load actors

The actors go in the demo's atespace, which the deploy step already created
(`--template-ref` resolves the template by name within the actor's own
atespace):

```sh
# Install the CLI as a kubectl plugin if not already installed
go install ./cmd/kubectl-ate

# Create 15 actors to generate load
for i in {001..015}; do
  kubectl ate create actor c$i -a ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool --template-ref counter
done
```

### 2. Port-forward the atenet router and send traffic

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n ate-system svc/atenet-router 8000:80 &
```

In a separate terminal, send requests in a retry loop across all hosts to activate the actors and keep them active while the pool scales up:

```sh
for attempt in {1..10}; do
  for i in {001..015}; do
    curl -s -H "Host: c$i.ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev" http://localhost:8000 >/dev/null
  done
  sleep 2
done
```

### 3. Watch the HPA scale up

As the assigned worker count increases, watch the HPA scale up the pool's replicas:

```sh
kubectl -n ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool get hpa counter -w
kubectl -n ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool get workerpool counter -w
```

### 4. Trigger scale-down

Suspend the actors to drop the assigned worker count. After the 300s stabilization window, the HPA will scale down the pool:

```sh
for i in {001..015}; do
  kubectl ate suspend actor c$i -a ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool
done
```

## How to Uninstall

First clean up the actors:

```sh
for i in {001..015}; do
  kubectl ate delete actor c$i -a ate-demo-autoscaled-workerpool
done
```

Then remove the demo resources and namespace:

```sh
./hack/install-ate-kind.sh --delete-demo-autoscaled-workerpool
```
